# Awesome Books

> Solo programming project for week seven of the Microverse Program.

![Desktop Version](./images/desktop_version.png)
![Mobile Version](./images/mobile.png)

"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list.

For this project, we must use ES6 modules.

### First requirements:

Project requirements

    Implement only a basic UI with plain HTML:

Basic UI

    Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
    Create a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
    Create a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
    Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
    Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
        A new book is added to the collection.
        The new book is displayed in the page.
    Make sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
        The correct book is removed from the collection.
        The correct book dissapears from the page.
    Make sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
    To debug your application, you can use console.log(). Remember to remove debugging code before pushing your code to the remote repository.
    Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.

TIP: If you separated the code in multiple files and you you have the following issues with the linter: complaining about having multiple classes at the same file, or an unused variables, disable the linter check for that rule in the file with a /_ eslint-disable rule-you-want-to-disable _/ .

Check the ESLint documentation for more details on how.

> To setup the project on your machine:

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and setup the linter

## Prerequisites

- npm ( Node Package Manager )
- git and Github Account

### Setup

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Open terminal
- Change the directory you want put the repo
- Then run
  i. Run git clone git@github.com:mengiefen/awesome-books.git
  ii. cd repo-name/

### Install

- **Webhint** linter

  `npm install --save-dev hint@6.x`

- **Stylelint** linter

  `npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x`

- **ESLint** linter

  `npm install --save-dev eslint@7.x eslint-config-airbnb-base@14.x eslint-plugin-import@2.x babel-eslint@10.x`

### Run tests

- **Webhint** linter -`npx hint .` on the root of your directory of your project.
- **Stylelint** linter
  - `npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"` on the root of your directory of your project.
- **ESLint** linter
  - `npx eslint .` on the root of your directory of your project.

### Second requirements:

> Use JavaScript classes instead of objects and arrays.

    You can use objects and arrays, but do it inside classes.
    Create class methods to add and remove books.
    Maintain all of the original functionality of the application (i.e. no bugs were introduced while refactoring).
    Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.
    Add CSS styles to the application to make it match the wireframe proposed by Microverse

Basic UI

    You can use the styles of your choice (colors, fonts, backgrounds, etc.), but try to follow the general layout.
    Concentrate on the general layout, rather than the details.
